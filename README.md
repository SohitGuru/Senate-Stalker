# About 
*Senate Stalker* is a program that helps you learn more about the U.S. senators! Simply type `make gui` or `make repl` to get the program started. Once you're done with your stalking 👀, save what you learned about a senator in a markdown file so that you are best prepared for the next senate elections! 👍

Happy stalking <3 🕵️
