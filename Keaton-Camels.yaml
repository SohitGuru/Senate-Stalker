  Our project provides information to a user about any given United States 
  senator! Information about the senator such as their Party, State, Address, 
  Phone Number, Email, Website, and Committees they are part of will be fetched 
  and provided to the client. We also have a Stocks and Nominate feature, which 
  retrieves all of the stock investments and the political leaning of a senator 
  respectively. Most of the information we will retrieve for the specified 
  politician will involve us utilizing OCaml web scraping libraries
  (Mechaml) and working with JSON. Moreover, clients are able to save the
  information on a senator of their choosing into a markdown file, if they want.
  We have a GUI as well created by using Lablgtk2 and a terminal-based UI; 
  both of which, the user has the option to pick to run the program. Our GUI 
  provides a helpful guide into how our program works and brief explanation of 
  the senate elections.
