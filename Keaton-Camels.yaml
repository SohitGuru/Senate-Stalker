  This project provides information to a client about a given United States 
  senator. Information about the senator would include voting records, speeches,
  social media posts, campaign donors, etc. Most of the information we will 
  retrieve for the specified politician will involve us utilizing OCaml web 
  scraping libraries (Mechaml) and working with JSON. Essentially, the program 
  will put the information on the politician into a markdown file. As a stretch 
  goal, we can implement a GUI interface for the politician lookup and 
  information output.
