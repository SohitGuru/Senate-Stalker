  To many in the country, politics is a mystery—a passing hobby. A large reason for
  this is that political information, especially information around the Senate, is 
  incredibly hard to find, parse, and understand. As such, we hope to create a tool 
  that allows users to see the data they want on any current U.S. Senator—all easily 
  accessible, understandable, and in one place. Thus, our project provides 
  information to a user about any given United States senator! Information 
  about the senator such as their Party, State, Address, Phone Number, Email, 
  Website, and Committees they are part of will be fetched and provided to the client
  when asked. We also have a Stocks and Nominate feature, which retrieves all
  of the stock investments and the political leaning of a senator. 
  Moreover, clients are able to save the information on a senator of their 
  choosing into a markdown file, if they so wish. Most of the information we retrieved for a 
  senator involved us using OCaml web scraping libraries (Mechaml) and working 
  with JSON. We have a GUI as well, created by using Lablgtk2,and a terminal-based UI, 
  developed by using ANSI-terminal; both of which, the user has the option to pick in order
  to run the program. Our GUI provides a helpful guide into how our program works and
  a brief explanation of the senate elections too!
