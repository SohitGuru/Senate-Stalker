  Our project provides information to a client about a given United States 
  senator! Information about the senator such as their Party, State, Address, Phone Number,
  Email, Website, and Committees they are part of will be fetched and provided to the client.
  Most of the information we will retrieve for the specified politician will involve 
  us utilizing OCaml web scraping libraries (Mechaml) and working with JSON. 
  Essentially, the program will put the information on the politician into a markdown file. 
  
  A standard interface between the client and terminal is used. However, we plan on
  building and implementing a GUI involving the Senator and their associated information soon!
