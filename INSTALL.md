# **System Requirements**

Run this program on OCaml version 4.14.0

***Install Guides***

Make sure to have the lablgtk ( `opam install lablgtk` ), lambda soup (which is installed with the installation of mechaml), and mechaml ( `opam install mechaml` ) modules installed! Also,
very important, run ( `opam install tls` ) before you start.

## How to start the Stalking

Type `make gui` or `make repl` in your terminal to get started!

When given the prompt to get information on a Senator, make sure to type
`Fetch` and the information you want (e.g. Party or Name) followed by the
Senator's name. If you want to exit from the program, simply enter `Quit` .
Otherwise, if you want a list of the names of all the Senators, just
type `List`.
All other commands are explained in the program U.I.! Happy stalking <3
